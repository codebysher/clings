# ðŸ§© clings â€” Learn C by fixing small programs

**clings** is a Rustlings-style interactive C learning project.  
Each exercise contains broken code â€” your job is to fix it until all tests pass!

## ðŸš€ Usage
```bash
make test       # run all tests once
./run.sh        # run continuous tests like 'rustlings watch'
